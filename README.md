🏥 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnosis using medical data. A Random Forest classifier is trained on the Breast Cancer dataset to accurately classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

🎯 Objective

1.Predict disease from patient medical features

2.Train and evaluate a classification model

3.Demonstrate sample prediction

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python • Scikit-learn • NumPy • Pandas

📂 Dataset

1.Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (built-in)
2.Loaded directly from Scikit-learn
3.Contains diagnostic medical features
4.Binary classification: Malignant / Benign

🧠 Model

Random Forest Classifier with train-test split and performance evaluation.

📊 Performance

Model Accuracy: ~95–99% (varies slightly per run)

▶️ How to Run
git clone https://github.com/barkaviraids2025-commits/CodeAlpha_Disease_Prediction_Project
1.cd CodeAlpha_Disease_Prediction
2.pip install -r requirements.txt
3.python disease_prediction.py

🔮 Output
1.Model accuracy
2.Classification report
3.Sample disease prediction
